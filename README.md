# GitHub Organization Repository Metrics Report Action

> A GitHub Action to generate a report that contains various metrics for all repositories belonging to a GitHub organization.

## Usage

The example [workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) below runs on a monthly [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) using the amount of days counted from today set as the interval in the workflow (default 30 days) but can also be triggered manually using a [workflow_dispatch] input using a historic interval as dispatch inputs.

```yml
name: Org Repo Metrics Report

on:
  schedule:
    # Runs on the first day of the month at 00:00 UTC
    #
    #        ┌────────────── minute
    #        │ ┌──────────── hour
    #        │ │ ┌────────── day (month)
    #        │ │ │ ┌──────── month
    #        │ │ │ │ ┌────── day (week)
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *'

## Workflow dispatch inputs

The additional option to retrieve organization metrics using a custom date interval.
If the below fields are left empty during [workflow_dispatch] input, the default interval option of set days from the current date configured in `action.yml` will be used instead.

| Name                           | Value                                   | Required |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `Optional interval start date` | A date matching the format `yyyy-mm-dd` | `false`  |
| `Optional interval end date`   | A date matching the format `yyyy-mm-dd` | `false`  |

## CSV / JSON layout

The results of all except the first column will be the sum or average of acquired metrics for the requested interval or all time per organization repository.
The last row of the report will contain the totals per column for all repositories combined.

A CSV report file to be saved in the repository **reports** folder using the following naming format: **`organization`-`reportdate`-`interval`.csv**.

## GitHub App authentication

As an alternative you can use GitHub App authentication to generate the report.
For larger organizations it is recommended to use this method as more API requests per hour are allowed which will avoid running into [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/building-github-apps/rate-limits-for-github-apps) errors.

[Register](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app) a new organization/personal owned GitHub App with the below permissions:

| GitHub App Permission                     | Access           |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| `Repository Permissions:Contents`         | `read and write` |
| `Repository Permissions:Issues`           | `read`           |
| `Repository Permissions:Pull Requests`    | `read`           |
| `Organization Permissions:Administration` | `read`           |
| `Organization Permissions:Members`        | `read`           |

After registration [install the GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/installing-github-apps) on your organization. Store the below App values as secrets.
